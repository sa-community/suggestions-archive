The spread rate (how random the spread will be) and spread options (what and how the spread tool should spread about the shape) could be helpful as well. And it may also create a new object to easily play with the new spread shapes. This can also be used on areas, which will spread the selected area. A little off but all the spread options, including spread rate (?), might have an option to randomize the value of itself.<br>Interestingly, you can actually see this in many world-building games as spreading the current &quot;brushed&quot; terrain over the nearby terrain.</div>{% endraw %}</span>
