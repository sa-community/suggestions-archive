Here‚Äôs how to recreate the bug:</div><div class="paragraph">‚Ä¢ Draw a square in the vector costume editor.<br>‚Ä¢Select the reshape tool.<br>‚Ä¢ Create a vertex a short distance from every corner of the square (on both sides of each corner, so that you have create 8 vertices).<br>‚Ä¢ Then delete original corners. </div><div class="paragraph">You should notice that the bottom-left rounded corner is not like the others. As someone who regularly uses rounded squares as buttons in my projects, this really bugs me. I would be very great full if there‚Äôs anything you can do to fix it!
