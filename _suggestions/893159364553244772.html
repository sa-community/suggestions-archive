The replies fade out while this button appears as you scroll. The button doesn&#x27;t act like a see more to the comment thread though, it just takes you to the comment section as if you entered the project itself directly and went into the comment section. This leads to the comment and naturally its replies to completely disappear as it returns to the original layout and there is no highlihting and you have a lesser chance of even getting back to it in a project with a lot of comments.</div>{% endraw %}</span>
