So, I have a pretty large project and often when I go to save the project, it comes up with the warning that says &quot;This project could not be saved, please try again.&quot; And, every time when I try again, it just saves like nothing ever happened. So, I would really appreciate a feature that would make Scratch try to save again maybe like 2 more times if it fails the first time. But, if it keeps failing to save after say 3 attempts, the project would alert the user with the usual pop up. Please implement this! I think it would be an amazing addition!</div>{% endraw %}</span>
