		Welcome!

		This site is an archive of suggestions for
		<a href="https://scratchaddons.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Scratch Addons</a>
		taken from the now-locked
		<a href="https://discord.gg/FPv957V6SD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">

			A few things to note:
			<ul>
				<li>
					This site attempts to recreate Discord's UI, but not all elements of it were
					implemented. Please view suggestions in Discord when possible to get the full
					context.
				</li>
				<li>
					Not all suggestions have been ported to this site. Only suggestions that were
					answered as "Good Idea" or "In Development", or those left unanswered, were
					ported. In other words, only suggestions that still have the capacity to be
					implemented. Rejected and implemented suggestions can be found by searching the
					Discord server.
				</li>
				<li>
					Suggestions from both the newer suggestions form channel and the
					pre-October-2022 bot-managed channel were ported. Form suggestions have the
					<img
						src="{{ site.data.emojis[':potato_upvote:'] }}"
						alt=":potato_upvote:"
						class="discord-custom-emoji"
					/>
					emoji, while legacy suggestions have the
					<img src="{{ site.data.emojis['ðŸ‘Ž'] }}" alt="ðŸ‘Ž" class="discord-custom-emoji" />
					emoji.
				</li>
				<li>
					Additionally, duplicates of the suggestions that were ported were not removed.
				</li>

				Pull Requests
			</a>
			to modify this site are welcome:
			<ul>
				<li>
					To (re-)answer a suggestion. Rejected and implemented suggestions are hidden
					from suggestion lists, but the actual suggestion page will remain as to not
					break links.
				</li>
				<li>To clarify a suggestion title if the original one is too ambiguous.</li>
				<li>To add a user's Scratch or GitHub account to their author page.</li>
				<li>To fix bugs and styling issues.</li>
			</ul>
