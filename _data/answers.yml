Good Idea:
    description:
        This is suitable to be added, *if someone codes it*. If nobody codes it, it will not be
        added.

In Development:
    description:
        Someone is currently working on this feature. It could be added in the next update, a later
        update, or possibly even not at all if the addon has problems.

Implemented:
    description:
        This feature already exists in browsers, vanilla Scratch, or SA. If you can't find it, it
        might be part of the next SA update.

Incompatible:
    description:
        This would make projects break for people without SA or with the addon disabled. For
        example, adding new blocks. The Scratch Team would not like projects that require you to
        have SA.

Impractical:
    description:
        This would probably be too difficult or janky to add using the methods we know about.
        Someone could put in effort to make it work, but it's not likely.

Rejected:
    description:
        This is technically possible, but is not suitable to be added for some reason. For example,
        it could be unethical or too niche.

Impossible:
    description:
        This feature would be impossible to implement for technical reasons. Scratch Addons can not
        change the core workings of Scratch.
